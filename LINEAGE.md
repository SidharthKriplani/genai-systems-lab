# LINEAGE

Build history of genai-systems-lab — what was built, what inspired it, and why each decision was made. Complements DECISIONS.md (which tracks architectural choices) and IDEAS.md (which tracks future work).

---

## Origin

Started as a personal reference tool: "what would I actually want when preparing for an ML engineering interview or ramping up on production AI systems?" The answer was interactive simulations, not static notes.

Core insight: most GenAI learning resources are either too academic (papers, textbooks) or too shallow (blog posts). The gap is production-depth interactivity — tools that let you reason through real decisions, not just read about them.

---

## Tab Lineage

### Systems Lab
**Origin:** Needed a place to practice production ML thinking — cost/latency trade-offs, eval design, incident diagnosis. Started with 4 modules (Evals, Cost/Latency, Model Strategy, Should Use AI?).

**Growth driver:** Each module revealed gaps in the adjacent space. Evals → needed Eval Frameworks. Cost → needed Model Router. Incidents → needed Observability. Now 38+ modules.

**Key design choice:** GROUP by intent (DESIGN/BUILD/OPS), not by topic. A user asking "how do I decide?" (DESIGN) is in a different mode than "how do I build this?" (BUILD) or "how do I keep it running?" (OPS).

**Modules and their inspiration:**
- **Evals Lab** — Most teams don't know how to design evals. Built as a decision simulator.
- **Cost/Latency Lab** — Token economics are non-obvious. Built to make the math tangible.
- **Incident Room** — Production incidents are the best learning. Simulated real failure patterns.
- **KV Cache Engineering** — Core inference concept almost no tutorial explains well.
- **Transformer Architecture** — Visual, interactive deep-dive. Inspired by 3Blue1Brown's approach.
- **MoE Architecture** — Mixtral, DeepSeek, Grok made MoE mainstream. Needed coverage.
- **Speculative Decoding** — Huge throughput win, underexplained. Built the draft→target loop visually.
- **Flash Attention** — Every serving engineer needs to understand IO complexity. Built the tiling diagram.
- **Quantization Engineering** — AWQ vs GPTQ vs GGUF is a common interview topic with no good reference.
- **Serving Infrastructure** — vLLM/SGLang/TRT-LLM landscape changes fast. Built the comparison table.
- **Agent Architecture** — ReAct loop, planning patterns, tool design. Most practical agent content.
- **RLHF/DPO/PPO** — Alignment training is increasingly expected knowledge for ML engineers.

### Ground Truth
**Origin:** The app needed long-form reference material that went deeper than module cards. Built as a "production engineering blog" embedded in the app.

**Series structure inspiration:** Most blogs are chronological. GT organizes by series — coherent learning arcs. Inspired by Stripe's engineering blog series format.

**Series and their origins:**
- **Frontier Intelligence** — Model-level deep dives: Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, Llama. For engineers who want to understand the models they ship with.
- **Agent Engineering** — Practical agent architecture. Inspired by the gap between "agent demos" and production reliability.
- **RAG Playbook** — RAG is the most common production pattern. Needed a canonical reference.
- **The Training Stack** — SFT → RLHF → DPO → distillation. The full alignment pipeline in one series.
- **How I'd Build X** — First-person opinionated walkthroughs. Inspired by the "write the design doc first" approach to learning.
- **Data Flywheel** — Production AI improves from its own traffic. Underappreciated in most learning resources.

### PrepLab
**Origin:** Interview prep without passive review. Built as active recall with immediate feedback.

**Question types:** MCQ for factual/conceptual, text-type for system design. Text questions show a model answer for self-assessment — no automated grading, intentionally.

**Coverage target:** Every Systems module should have at least 4 PrepLab questions. Reached 183+ questions covering all 38+ modules.

### Explore
**Origin:** Reference lookup — "I need to remember how embedding models compare" or "what's the API pricing for GPT-4o mini?" Not interactive practice, not long reads. Fast reference.

**Design principle:** Explore = 2-3 tabs, first tab is the primary reference table, second is explanation/context. No heavy interactivity — that's what Systems is for.

**Modules and their origins:**
- **Embedding Model Selector** — Voyage vs Cohere vs OpenAI is a real decision teams face. Built the use-case wizard.
- **RAG Architecture Patterns** — Chunking strategy and retrieval pipeline decisions. High-frequency reference.
- **API Model Pricing** — Changes frequently. Built as a static snapshot with "check provider docs" caveat.
- **Benchmark Browser** — MMLU/HumanEval/MT-Bench comparison. Sortable by column.
- **Prompt Pattern Library** — Few-shot, CoT, structured output templates. The anti-patterns tab is the most useful part.
- **Context Engineering** — Window strategies and model context limits. Fast lookup.

### Career Tab
**Origin:** Interview prep beyond PrepLab — take-home challenge simulation. Long-form scenarios with rubrics.

---

## Architecture Lineage

### Tech Stack
- **React 18 + Vite 6** — Chosen for fast development iteration and zero-config bundling.
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — @tailwindcss/vite plugin, no PostCSS config. Dark theme built-in.
- **No TypeScript** — Deliberate. TypeScript casts in JSX cause Vercel build errors with this setup. Avoided from session 1.
- **No backend** — Static app on Vercel. All state in localStorage. No auth, no database.
- **No external UI library** — All components hand-rolled. Keeps bundle small, full design control.

### File Architecture
- **Systems.jsx** was a single 9,500+ line file until May 2026 when it was split.
- **Refactor:** `Systems.jsx` (139 lines — registry + SystemsApp) + `src/systems/modules.jsx` (9,500+ lines — all module components). Same external API, zero user-facing change.
- **Pattern for new modules:** Add component to `modules.jsx`, add entry to SYSTEMS_MODULES in `Systems.jsx`, add 4 PrepLab questions.

### Progress Tracking
- **May 2026:** Added localStorage-backed progress tracking. Key: `gsl-systems-done`. Mark-as-done toggle at bottom of each module. ✓ on pills, progress bar in header.
- **Decision:** localStorage only — no backend, no cross-device sync. Acceptable for a learning tool.

| May 2026 sprint 22 | GAL structural overhaul — all 4 phases. Product renamed GAL in sidebar logo. `NAV_GROUPS` rebuilt: BUILD (4 Labs) / PROVE (PrepLab) / NAVIGATE (Career + AI Product) / KNOWLEDGE (Concepts + GT). `ALL_TABS` group constants updated. Home.jsx door card labels updated: "Engineer" → "BUILD", "Interview Prep" → "PROVE", "Career / PM" → "NAVIGATE". `ProgressView` fully rewritten: three-lane layout (BUILD / PROVE / CONCEPTS). `FidelityBadge` component added to App.jsx, Agents.jsx, Systems.jsx — Variant A (✓ Scenario-accurate, emerald) for 11 modules across 4 labs, Variant B (~ Simulated, zinc) for all others. DECISIONS.md updated with primary user + nav architecture. Scale: unchanged. |
| May 2026 sprint 23 | GAL visual redesign — 4 fronts. (1) CSS accent vars: `--gal-build/prove/navigate/knowledge` added to `:root`; NAV_GROUPS color strings updated to `var()`. (2) Sidebar collapse: `collapsedGroups` Set + `toggleGroup()`; group header is clickable with chevron + item-count badge; animated via max-height inline style; desktop + mobile. (3) Home hierarchy: BUILD door card full-width dominant with 4 lab pills; PROVE + NAVIGATE secondary side-by-side; stats row removed; NAVIGATE color amber (was violet). (4) Lab shell consistency: RAG Lab sidebar header promoted to text-base; `ragDone` Set + `gsl-rag-done` localStorage + progress bar; Eval Lab gets GT chip. Premium animations added to index.css: tabFadeIn, fillBar, cardSlideUp with stagger delays, card-lift hover, Inter optical alternates, negative heading tracking. Scale: unchanged. |
| May 2026 sprint 24 | Full elevation token system — PAL-parity visual overhaul. Phase 1: `--bg` (#111520), `--surface` (#191e30), `--surface-2` (#1f2438), `--border` (#3d4668), `--border-subtle` (#2a3255) added to `:root`. App.jsx root div, both sidebars, RAG Lab inner sidebar, header, all modals (search/feedback/leaderboard/shortcuts) converted to tokens. Home.jsx all door cards, Today section, Continue button use `--surface-2`/`--border` — gradient overlays removed. Phase 2: `--color-zinc-900: #191e30` added to `:root` — single-declaration remap that converts 300+ `bg-zinc-900` panel backgrounds app-wide from cold `#18181b` to blue-tinted `#191e30` (same technique as sprint 8 zinc-500/600 contrast fix). All 5 lab sidebar shells (Systems, Agents, PrepLab, Concepts + RAG Lab in App.jsx) converted to `var(--surface)` + `var(--border)`. Net: GAL elevation system now matches PAL — bg → surface (sidebar) → surface-2 (cards) → border. Scale: unchanged. |
| May 2026 sprint 25 | No code shipped. Analysis + MD sync session. Read a third-party assessment of all three sibling labs (GAL, ML Systems Lab, PAL) for Quantiphi + Meesho interview prep. Assessment validated GAL's failure simulation mechanic and "feels like a real product" positioning, and identified one concrete ceiling: "excellent for production AI judgment, weaker for proving real backend/cloud execution." Bridge formula identified: lab concept → AWS service → client architecture → tradeoffs/failure modes. Four adaptations derived and logged: (1) "Maps to production" callout on root-cause cards (productionNote field per scenario, S effort), (2) Company-specific architecture layer in PrepLab Company Tracks, (3) "Your Interview Story" collapsible block on done cards, (4) single real execution artifact (FastAPI + ChromaDB demo repo linked from RAG Lab done card). MD files updated: IDEAS.md (new "Diagnosis-sourced adaptations" cluster in Tier 1), UPGRADES.md (two new S-effort High-priority entries), DECISIONS.md (Section 6 — format integrity rule: failure simulation must not converge with case-study format), NEXT.md (two quick-win items added to "If time allows" section). Scale: unchanged. |
