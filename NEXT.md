## ⚠ FIRST — verify 16 Jul wave (after Sidharth's push deploys)

Notes editor: ⇤⇥ buttons, Tab sub-bullets, hover timestamps, Cmd+Z everywhere. Track detail: quick-note composer GONE. Highlights: select text on any content page → swatches → paint; click → Remove; survives reload.

## ✅ DONE (25 Jun 2026) — Icon system migration (Sprint 91)

Full HQ canonical `Icon.jsx` (84 icons) deployed to `src/`; `CompanyLogo.jsx` + `companyDomains.js` added. 26 source files swept; local `CompanyLogo` in `PrepLab.jsx` replaced with HQ import. Targeted post-sweep fixes in 7 files. Commit prepared (approve-first). **No content changes; freeze and IA rebuild pause unchanged.**

---

## 🧭 NEXT IMMEDIATE BUILD — IA Rebuild (topic × layer grid)  ⏸ PAUSED 25 Jun

**The initiative:** kill the verb-axis nav fragmentation; re-home every surface into a **topic × layer grid** — 5 columns (Retrieval · Evaluation · Agents · Production · Foundations) × rows (**Learn / DO / BUILD / LIVE**). Rule: *"nothing deleted, just placed."* Full map + provenance: **`GSL-PLACEMENT-MAP.md`** (repo root).

> ⚠️ **FREEZE CONFLICT — read before resuming.** This is structural product work (a new "Start Here" surface + a nav rewire), which sits against the CONTENT FREEZE doctrine below. Phase 1 was user-directed and already shipped; treat P2–P4 as needing the same HQ-style override before building. Flagging, not deciding.

**Decisions locked (user, 24–25 Jun):**
- **Prompts → EXTRAS** (parked, not deleted). **Safety → EXTRAS** (parked).
- KNOW row relabels to **"Learn"**. "Foundations" naming nit (grid column vs the FM topic) parked.
- Concepts (atoms) + Learning Paths (threads) + GT (library) = one **Learn** surface; GT library to sit behind an **"open the whole universe?"** toggle.
- 4 historically-deleted files recovered → `_legacy/recovered/` (StartHere / Library / Labs + Blog tombstone). Restore-or-leave parked. **Nothing deleted by this work** — set-diff verified; `pre-overlap-baseline` tag + `_legacy/` archive are the undo.

**Phase status:**
- ✅ **P1 — Beginner ramp. BUILT + DEPLOYED + LIVE.** `src/StartHere.jsx` (new) — 5 in-place micro-lessons (token → embedding → cosine → next-token → context), monochrome, localStorage progress, SQLBolt read→poke→check loop (no tab-jumping). Wired additively into `App.jsx` (lazy import, `VALID_VIEWS`, route, KNOW nav item "Start Here"). Home cold-hero **front-door card** added (`src/Home.jsx`, `hero_starthere_cta`, above the RAG Lab card). All changes esbuild-clean, brace=0, **zero deletions**.
- ⏭️ **P2 — GT "open the whole universe?" toggle (NEXT UP).** `GroundTruth.jsx` already has `SERIES_META` + an "All posts" / "Show all posts →" mechanism (~lines 1545–1628; **312 posts**). Reframe: curated/series view as the calm default, full library behind an inviting reveal. Enhances existing — moderate care (file is 1,751 lines).
- ⏭️ **P3 — Learn Library rebuild.** `src/utils/contentAudit.js` `MODULE_CATALOG` is **STALE** (95 entries; ~15 concepts vs today's 116 + 57 systems). Must **regenerate the catalog** from live registries (Concepts `GYMS`, `SYSTEMS_MODULES`, Agents, GT) FIRST, then revive `_legacy/recovered/Library.jsx` (filter pills + grouped cards + collapsible "more"). Bigger.
- ⏭️ **P4 — Topic-grid rewire (the big one, LAST).** Implement the placement map: 5 columns × Learn/DO + global **BUILD** (project skeletons) / **LIVE** (Interview Room + negotiation sim+cards) / **EXTRAS** (Prompts, Safety, salary calc, AIPM, enterprise, multimodal). Slow, careful, only after P2+P3 are live.

**Recovered assets to mine:** `_legacy/recovered/Library.jsx` (ancestor of the Learn library + the universe-toggle pattern), `Labs.jsx`, `StartHere.jsx` (already mined for P1). `contentAudit.js` intact but stale.

**Build doctrine for this initiative:** additive-first; nothing moved/deleted until a phase is approved; every change gets esbuild + brace=0 + `git status` no-deletions check; user builds on Mac (`npm run build`) and pushes. Recovery point: tag `pre-overlap-baseline`.

---

## 🎨 SPRINT 90 (23–24 Jun) — Monochrome "instrument" theme
GSL got its per-lab visual identity: a greyscale instrument with one cyan accent (red=break / green=fix, semantic only). Spec locked in `HQ/DESIGN-STANDARD.md` ("THE MONOCHROME INSTRUMENT STANDARD").
- **Theme = one file.** `src/index.css` MONOCHROME INSTRUMENT block remaps Tailwind v4 `--color-*` → cold grey ramp + kill-rainbow + faint break/fix. Appended, dark-scoped, **reversible** (delete block → warm base returns). ✅ built on Mac + pushed + live.
- **Colour guard.** `scripts/check-no-hex.mjs` (+ `npm run check:color`) reports raw hex outside the token file (~1,860 stragglers = Layer C). ✅ live.
- **De-rainbow + rails.** GT cards → muted per-area hues; nav active = value-based (no cyan rail); **all decorative rails killed app-wide** (6 left + 66 top → hairlines; semantic green/red kept). ✅ first two pushed+live; ⏳ **the app-wide rail-kill + GT muted-hue pass (19 files) is OPEN in `PENDING_APPROVALS.md` — awaiting Mac build+push.**

## ✅ SHIPPED & LIVE (sprints 83–85) — logo + four-frame nav + SQL link fix all built, pushed, deployed.
- Logo / BrandMark (D-19): `f9d1a15` ✅ live.
- Four-frame accordion sidebar (HQ DESIGN-STANDARD, KNOW/DO/BUILD/JUDGE + PREP&ASSESS + BY DOMAIN): `e34aa48` ✅ live.
- DO→SQL link-out → PAL SQL Lab (`/#/sql-lab`): `0d23529` ✅ live. `origin/main` == HEAD (0 ahead/0 behind).

**Next session — deferred polish (none blocking; pick any):**
1. Nest the Ground Truth series as a KNOW sub-group (recursive accordion / one-open-per-sub).
2. Delete the dead in-component `NAV_GROUPS` + `toggleGroup`/`activeSection` (left as harmless dead code).
3. PL (Programming Lab) DO→Python link-out still points at the GitHub repo — swap to its live Vercel URL once known.
4. Add a dynamic-import error guard (auto-reload once) so users don't hit "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module" across deploys.
5. Fluency-tab dissolution into ⊗ Communication + ② DO (per `docs/NAV-REFRAME-SPEC.md` §4) — the nav row is relabeled "Interview Room", but the FluencyApp module split is not done.
6. Build the fluency code sliver (the DO "Code Drills" SOON marker) — gated behind distribution keystone + PSL's general-code bank.
7. **Layer-C viz tokenisation (the last colour slice):** the in-module visualization SVG hexes (attention/chunking/embedding/heatmap strokes) + the `CAT_COLORS`/`SERIES_META` string-concat colours still live as hex — monochrome-compliant values but not `var()` tokens. Tokenise → then flip the guard to `--strict`. `npm run check:color` for the inventory.
8. **3D embeddings instrument:** replace the 2D PCA scatter in the Word-Embeddings concept module with a rotatable 3D vector space (viz redesign, separate from theming).

*Last updated: sprint 90 (24 Jun 2026) — monochrome instrument theme: index.css remap + colour guard + app-wide rail-kill + GT muted hues; one OPEN push in `PENDING_APPROVALS.md`. Scale unchanged: 597 PrepLab questions, **320 GT index entries / 320 static GT pages (SSR)**, 6 challenge-area landing pages.*

> **CONTENT FREEZE IN EFFECT (shared doctrine — GSL `LINKEDIN.md` Rule 1 + MSL DEC-2026-06-21-A).** Distribution/content only. No new tabs, labs, scenarios, MCQs, or product features until distribution proves out. GT posts ARE the content-distribution surface, so they remain allowed; lab feature-building does not. _(Logo D-19 + the nav reframe were HQ-authorized overrides for those structural tasks only — reorg/relabel, no new content.)_

---

## Sprint 84 — ✅ COMPLETE (Four-frame accordion sidebar — HQ DESIGN-STANDARD; code written, approve-first)

**Objective:** Implement the HQ "THE SIDEBAR STANDARD — four-frame accordion nav" in GSL. Reorg/relabel of existing tabs under KNOW/DO/BUILD/JUDGE + PREP&ASSESS; cyan accent. No new content/tabs.

- **`src/App.jsx`** — module-scope nav kit (`FrameIcon` book-open/terminal/hammer/scale/clipboard, `SidebarChevron`, **measured-height `SidebarCollapsible`** per the standard — NOT grid 0fr→1fr, hoisted to avoid remount-snap, `SoonBadge`, `SidebarRow`, `MobileFrameNav`) + the four-frame data (`NAV_TRACK`, `NAV_SECTIONS`, `NAV_DOMAINS`, `TAB_FRAME`).
- **Desktop sidebar** rebuilt: TRACK (flat) → KNOW/DO/BUILD/JUDGE/PREP&ASSESS accordions (one-open-per-level via `openFrame` + `useEffect(topView)`) → BY DOMAIN (flat secondary lens). Active pill = `inset 3px var(--gal-build)` + cyan; `aria-expanded`/`aria-current`. DO rung shows a **SOON** "Code Drills" placeholder (the to-build fluency sliver) + **link-outs** (↗) to PL (Python·DSA) and PAL (SQL). Search stays pinned bottom.
- **Both mobile drawers** re-keyed to the same frames via `MobileFrameNav` (flat lists, consistent with desktop).
- **Verify:** all touched files Babel-parse clean; 0 `NAV_GROUPS.map` left. Native esbuild/Vite is macOS-only → **`npm run build` on the Mac is the deploy gate.**
- Dead-but-harmless leftovers (old in-component `NAV_GROUPS` data + `toggleGroup`/`activeSection`) left in place to minimize edit surface — flag for a later cleanup.

**Open follow-up:** macOS build + QA (accordion one-open-per-level, smooth measured-height open/close, frame icons, active cyan pill, SOON + ↗ link-outs, mobile drawers), then approve-first push. Optional polish later: nest GT series as a KNOW sub-group; delete the dead `NAV_GROUPS`; swap PL link-out to its live Vercel URL once it deploys.

---

## Sprint 83 — ✅ COMPLETE (BreakLabs logo / BrandMark, D-19 — code written, approve-first)

**Objective:** Implement the BreakLabs co-brand lockup per `docs/BRANDMARK-ROLLOUT.md`. Descriptor `GenAI Systems`, accent cyan `#22D3EE`; wordmark + red seam `#FB5247` are the cross-lab constant. HQ-authorized freeze override for this brand task.

- **`src/BrandMark.jsx`** (new) — canonical component (variants full/wordmark/monogram; seam red + wordmark constant; descriptor + accent per-lab). Single-quote house style.
- **`src/index.css`** — added lockup tokens `--ink-hi / --ink-low / --rim / --font-mono` (IBM Plex Mono) to the dark `:root` + dark-ink overrides in the `[data-theme="light"]` block (so the wordmark stays legible on the cream theme). Descriptor passed as `var(--gal-build)` → cyan in dark, legible violet in light (avoids cyan-on-cream contrast fail).
- **Slots wired (1–7):** (1) sidebar logo **and** mobile-drawer logo → stacked wordmark + cyan descriptor (replaced both old purple "G" boxes); (4) signed-out Home hero → large wordmark; (5) `GateOverlay` sign-in/paywall header → wordmark; (6) sidebar footer → monogram + "part of BreakLabs"; (7) Suspense loading splash → monogram. (2) **favicon** → new `public/favicon.svg` monogram + `<link rel=icon>` in `index.html` (none existed before). (3) **OG** → rebranded `public/og-image.png` (1200×630, lockup + tagline). Slot 8 (newsletter) out of scope.
- **Archive (D-18):** old `public/og-image.png` → `_legacy/og-image.png` (no prior favicon existed).
- **Verify:** all four edited JSX files parse clean (Babel); both old "G" logos gone; 6 `BrandMark` call-sites. **Native esbuild/Vite can't run in the sandbox (ARM64) — `npm run build` on macOS is the deploy gate.**

**Open follow-up:** macOS `npm run build` + the QA checklist, then approve-first push (commands in `PENDING_APPROVALS.md`). When the GSL nav reframe (Sprint 82 spec) later runs, slot 1 rides that rebuild — keep one BrandMark source of truth.

---

## Sprint 82 — ✅ COMPLETE (Four-frame nav reframe + fluency-sliver spec — PROPOSE-ONLY, no code)

**Objective:** Reorganize GSL's nav so every surface maps to its primary frame; dissolve the mislabeled "Fluency" tab; define GSL's real fluency frame as a small to-build spec. Reorg/relabel existing content only — no new content, no code bank built (freeze respected).

- Output: **`docs/NAV-REFRAME-SPEC.md`** (the deliverable — target frame IA, full placement table for all surfaces, the exact mechanical `App.jsx`/`Fluency.jsx` edits, build/QA/push checklist) + an addendum on `docs/FOUR-FRAME-AUDIT.md`.
- **`App.jsx` NOT edited** (propose-only): the reframe can't be build-verified in the sandbox (Rollup ARM64), `git push` auto-deploys to Vercel, it spans several nav structures + ~5 consumer deep-links, and DEC-15 sequences the overhaul for later. On approval it's a mechanical post-approval commit (macOS build).
- **"Fluency" tab dissolved (decided):** Phrase Bank / Flashcards / Timed Drills / Mock Interview → ⊗ Communication; Company Cases + Readiness Check → ④ Judgment (Readiness under ASSESS); Prompt Engineering + Prompt Challenges → ② Fluency (seed). Frame is **seeded, not hollow**.
- **GSL fluency frame defined (narrow sliver, TO-BUILD):** deterministic LLM-systems code in Pyodide (chunker, retrieval/rerank glue, structured-output parse+validate, agent tool-loop w/ stop, eval scorers, cosine), **mock model output as the failure injector**, mostly a secondary "now fix it in code" layer on judgment surfaces, gradeable prompt forms only, **general code/algorithms/SQL delegated to PSL**. Framed as implementation/code-fix literacy, not algorithmic speed. **Spec'd, not built.**

**Open follow-up (post-approval / when freeze lifts):** implement the `NAV_GROUPS` reframe + Fluency dissolution on macOS (per spec §6); then build the fluency code sliver (after PSL's general-code bank exists to delegate to).

**Cross-lab:** frame-label naming (GSL "Foundations/Fluency/Ownership/Judgment" vs MSL "KNOW/DO/BUILD/JUDGE") is pending HQ — `HQ/LEDGER.md [2026-06-22] ⊥ pending HQ`. Spec uses placeholder labels.

---

## Sprint 81 — ✅ COMPLETE (Four-Frame Reframe Audit — read-only / propose-only)

**Objective:** Audit GSL's existing surface against the Competence Model (`HQ/COMPETENCE-MODEL.md`, DEC-15) — map every tab/engine/content type to the four frames (recall+depth → fluency → ownership → judgment), find the thin frames, propose (not build) an IA reframe. **No nav rebuilt, no content added, no code touched.**

- Output: **`docs/FOUR-FRAME-AUDIT.md`** (the deliverable — read it).
- Verdict: **GSL is a barbell** — DEEP on recall+depth (320 GT + 15 Concepts + 6 Flows) AND DEEP on judgment (RAG Lab + 37 Systems + 597-Q PrepLab), with **fluency near-MISSING** (no code-authoring bank; the "Fluency" tab is mis-named — it's *communication*) and **ownership scaffold-only** (Guided ProjectLabs + how-i-build; capture is correctly Career OS's).
- Headline gap: the fluency rung is broken — the lab *tests* judgment heavily but never *trains* the executing-fluency judgment is meant to stand on.
- Proposed build order (per DEC-15): relabel depth (free) → **build the fluency problem bank first** → thicken ownership scaffold → nest (don't grow) judgment.
- **Propose-only. The restructure is NOT built. Gated behind the content freeze + distribution keystone — this is the target structure for a future overhaul, not this session's work.**

**Open follow-up (when the freeze lifts / overhaul is greenlit):** rename the "Fluency" tab out of the way; stand up a timed, correctness-checked GenAI code/prompt problem bank (the missing frame-2 surface).

---

## Sprint 80 — ✅ COMPLETE (BUILD SESSION A — distribution/content only)

**Objective:** Two LinkedIn / Ground-Truth posts for the growth pipeline — PixelRAG (embeddings-series finale) + Headroom (context-engineering / token-compression). Content only; no lab features (freeze respected).

1. ~~**PixelRAG GT post**~~ — `pixelrag-visual-document-rag` added to `groundTruthPosts.js` + `groundTruthIndex.js` (series `nlp-origins`, the embeddings finale). Grounded in the 2025 paper (*Web Screenshots Beat Text for RAG*, Berkeley/Princeton/EPFL/Databricks): render→tile→Qwen3-VL-Embedding(LoRA)→FAISS→VLM-reads-pixels. Honest — frontier tool not a default; paper's own numbers (8.28M pages/30M screenshots, up to 18.1%, ~3× token cut) framed as the authors' reported results. LinkedIn visual = **reuse of the existing ep5 carousel** (`growth/linkedin/visuals/embeddings/ep5_pixelrag/`).
2. ~~**Headroom GT post**~~ — `headroom-context-compression` added (series `llmops`). Honest third-party teardown: why raw tool outputs/RAG chunks burn tokens, type-aware compression (60–95% fewer tokens), reversible CCR, and **where it breaks** (lossy compression on precise data → silent wrong answers). Their benchmarks framed as vendor-reported.
3. ~~**Tracker updated**~~ — Content Master Tracker rows #25 (PixelRAG caption + ep5 visual path) and #26 (Headroom, backlog/Idea row, caption + visual TBD). No dates assumed — both stay backlog/Idea.
4. ~~**Build verified**~~ — `node --check` clean on both src files; `prerender-gt.js` regenerated 320 pages incl. both new static pages + sitemap. (vite/rollup step fails only in the Linux sandbox — missing `@rollup/rollup-linux-arm64-gnu`; not a code issue, builds on Mac.)

**Open follow-up (post-approval):** Headroom LinkedIn visual not yet rendered (content-first gate). Proposed: a Glass-Box before/after annotation card (raw 65,694-token dump → 5,118, break-annotation on a dropped exact value). Render once approved, then set tracker #26 Visual File/Path.

---

## Sprint 69 — ✅ COMPLETE (`785c494`)

**Objective:** Difficulty tier expansion + curriculum quality overhaul (beginner → daunting).

1. ~~**GT sidebar cleanup**~~ — removed 10 advanced series from GT sidebar in App.jsx. Kept: Agent Engineering, RAG in Production, The Training Stack, LLMOps in Production, How I'd Build X, NLP Origins, Build From Scratch, LLM Internals, Retrieval Depth, Evaluation Depth, ML Foundations.
2. ~~**Difficulty tier schema**~~ — 5 new difficulty values added: `beginner`, `beginner-intermediate`, `intermediate`, `staff`, `daunting`. New `type: "daunting"` with `answers: [{label, content, correct}]` + `synthesis_note`.
3. ~~**DauntingQuestion UI**~~ — toggle-expandable answer panels in BrowseMode, multiple correct answers with overlap. Full `openAnswers` state, violet theme.
4. ~~**`foundations` topic**~~ — added to `TOPIC_COLORS`, `TOPIC_LABELS`, and `engineering` focus in `drawQuestions`.
5. ~~**BrowseMode filter chips**~~ — expanded from `[easy, medium, hard]` to all 8 difficulty values. `beginner-intermediate` displays as `B-I`.
6. ~~**40 new questions**~~ — 8 beginner + 8 B-I Foundations, 8 beginner + 8 B-I RAG, 3 Staff Foundations, 2 Staff RAG, 2 Daunting.

**New scale:** 528 PrepLab questions (was 488).

---

## Sprint 70 — ✅ COMPLETE (`11e8d3f`)

**Objective:** First Principles learning path + bidirectional PrepLab linking.

1. ~~**First Principles Path**~~ — added to top of `PATHS` array in `LearningPaths.jsx`. 14 GT steps from ngrams-to-neural → react-pattern + PrepLab CTA. Violet `#8b5cf6` color theme.
2. ~~**Sidebar entry**~~ — "First Principles Path" added as first subitem under Ground Truth in App.jsx. `note: "start here"`. Routes to `paths` tab.
3. ~~**Bidirectional linking**~~ — `GT_QUESTION_MAP` built at module load from PREP_QUESTIONS readMore.postId fields. `LinkedQuestions` component shows per-step practice questions (expandable, difficulty chips, Try → button).
4. ~~**Coverage verified**~~ — 12 of 14 GT steps have linked questions. `ngrams-to-neural` has 1 (found-beg-1). `react-pattern` has 0 (no questions link to it yet — future work).

---

## Sprint 71 — ✅ COMPLETE (`ff62da0`)

**Objective:** Complete the First Principles Path question coverage — intermediate tier + react-pattern gap.

1. ~~**8 intermediate Foundations questions**~~ — `found-int-1` through `found-int-8`. Encoder vs decoder, LoRA rank, multi-head attention, perplexity limits, catastrophic forgetting, fine-tune vs prompt decision, KV cache memory cost, MHA vs GQA architecture choice.
2. ~~**4 intermediate RAG questions**~~ — `rag-int-1` through `rag-int-4`. Hybrid search failure analysis, chunk size framework, reranker latency tradeoff, RAG vs fine-tuning decision.
3. ~~**3 react-pattern questions**~~ — `react-1` (beginner), `react-2` (B-I), `react-3` (intermediate). Closes the last empty step in First Principles Path.
4. ~~**2 broken readMore postIds fixed**~~ — `found-beg-6` and `found-bi-5` had `postId: "long-context-window"` → corrected to `context-window-guide`.

**New scale:** 543 PrepLab questions (was 528).

---

## Sprint 72 — ✅ COMPLETE (`d57d929`)

**Objective:** First Principles path UX — B1–B6 complete.

1. ~~**B1 pathContext threading**~~ — `goToStep(step, idx)` passes full pathContext through App.jsx → GroundTruth.jsx → PostDetail.
2. ~~**B2 Path context bar**~~ — colored banner in GT reader: abbr badge, path name, step N of M, prev/next GT step nav, ↩ Path.
3. ~~**B3 3-mode reader**~~ — Skim / Read / Dense replacing old simpleMode boolean.
4. ~~**B4 Callout openers**~~ — `{t:"callout"}` first block on all 14 First Principles path posts.
5. ~~**B5 Path-aware footer**~~ — progress bar + "Next: [label] →" CTA + "View path summary →" on last step.
6. ~~**B6 Mark done**~~ — toggles `gsl-path-progress[pathId]` localStorage, green indicator in both context bar and footer.
7. ~~**Emoji removal**~~ — all 8 PATHS + TYPE_CONFIG replaced with monospace abbr badges.

---

## Sprint 73 — ✅ COMPLETE (`b72aaaa`, `ee7b242`)

**Objective:** Batch A — agent production gap fill (MCP, tool use, observability, testing).

1. ~~**4 GT posts (agent-production series)**~~ — `mcp-explained`, `agent-tool-use-production`, `agent-observability`, `agent-testing-strategies`.
2. ~~**26 PrepLab questions**~~ — mcp-1–6, toolprod-1–6, obs-1–6, agtest-1–8.
3. ~~**AgentsHub +4 posts**~~ — all 4 Batch A posts surfaced on AgentsHub.
4. ~~**ProductionHub +1**~~ — agent-observability added.
5. ~~**EvaluationHub +1**~~ — agent-testing-strategies added.
6. ~~**Sidebar "Agents in Production" link**~~ — added to GT sidebar series section.

**New scale:** 569 PrepLab questions (543+26), 305 GT index entries (301+4), 13 GT series.

---

## Sprint 74 — ✅ COMPLETE (`82a1aae`)

**Objective:** Batch B — agent backend infra gap fill (backend APIs, async task queues, K8s).

1. ~~**3 GT posts (agent-production series)**~~ — `agent-backend-apis` (async endpoints, SSE, request deduplication, readiness probes, rate limiting), `async-task-queues-agents` (task state machine, exactly-once execution, Celery chord fan-out, DLQ, result TTL), `kubernetes-ai-workloads` (GPU scheduling, model loading patterns, KEDA vs HPA, PDB, probe config).
2. ~~**17 PrepLab questions**~~ — apiback-1–6, taskqueue-1–6, k8sagent-1–5.
3. ~~**ProductionHub +3 posts**~~ — all 3 Batch B posts added.
4. ~~**SERIES_META updated**~~ — agent-production postIds extended to 7.

**New scale:** 586 PrepLab questions (was 569), 308 GT index entries (was 305).

---

## Sprint 75 — ✅ COMPLETE (`fb960b4`)

**Objective:** Batch C — agent security + governance gap fill.

1. ~~**2 GT posts (agent-production series)**~~ — `agent-security` (indirect/direct/tool-result injection, OWASP LLM01/07/08/02, least privilege classification, guardrails, supply chain), `agent-governance` (data lineage, model version pinning + stage promotion, prompt versioning as code, rollback triggers, HITL approval gates).
2. ~~**11 PrepLab questions**~~ — sec-1–6, govern-1–5.
3. ~~**Hub updates**~~ — AgentsHub +agent-security, ProductionHub +agent-governance.
4. ~~**SERIES_META updated**~~ — agent-production postIds extended to 9. Batches A+B+C complete.

**New scale:** 597 PrepLab questions (was 586), 310 GT index entries (was 308).

---

## Sprint 76 — ✅ COMPLETE (`0e5682e`)

**Objective:** Senior AI Engineer learning path.

1. ~~**Senior AI Engineer: Production Track path**~~ — 13 steps in LearningPaths.jsx. Cyan `#06b6d4`. Covers MCP, tool use, agent architecture, observability, testing, backend APIs, async queues, K8s, security, governance, guardrails, LLMOps. Full Batches A+B+C coverage.
2. ~~**Sidebar entry**~~ — "Senior AI Engineer Track" added as second path subitem under Ground Truth in App.jsx. Note: "production".

**Scale:** unchanged (597q/310GT — no new content).

---

## Sprint 77 — ✅ COMPLETE (competitive audit + MD sync)

**Objective:** Competitive intelligence research + log all findings to MD files.

1. ~~**Competitive audit completed**~~ — full research on Dataford, Hello Interview, DataLemur, Exponent, Interview Query, DeepLearning.AI, fast.ai, HF, W&B, LangChain Academy, cheating tool cohort, distribution mechanics (NeetCode, ByteByteGo).
2. ~~**COMPETITORS.md created**~~ — full competitive intelligence report. Tier 1/2/3 threat breakdown, market data, proven mechanics, GSL differentiators vs gaps, 90-day bridge plan.
3. ~~**IDEAS.md updated**~~ — added "Distribution & Growth" section (P0 SSR, P0 LinkedIn cadence, P1 certificates, P1 onboarding capture, P1 Discord, P2 newsletter, P2 canonical artifact).
4. ~~**DECISIONS.md §13 added**~~ — competitive positioning decisions: lane owned, four proven win mechanics, moat to defend, anti-patterns to avoid, pricing informed by research.
5. ~~**Sidebar labels shortened**~~ — "1st Principles" / "Senior AIE" (committed previous session).

---

## Sprint 78 — ✅ COMPLETE (`7b114e0`)

**Objective:** Certificates, onboarding modal, agent synthesis gap, trap quality pass.

1. ~~**CertificateModal.jsx**~~ — canvas-based PNG certificate for path completion. Download PNG + LinkedIn share button. Appears in LearningPaths.jsx footer when `done.size === path.steps.length`. Renders path name, user name (from Supabase user object), date, abbr badge, GSL branding, accent-colored borders. `user` prop wired from App.jsx → LearningPathsApp.
2. ~~**OnboardingModal.jsx**~~ — 3-question first-sign-in flow. Questions: time horizon (2w/1m/3m/exploring), target role (AIE/Applied Scientist/MLOps/AI PM), biggest gap (retrieval/agents/evaluation/production/foundations). Auto-routes to challenge area hub on completion. Saves to `gsl-onboarding` localStorage. Triggered in App.jsx SIGNED_IN event (only — not INITIAL_SESSION). Progress-dot indicator + pill animation. `hasCompletedOnboarding()` guard prevents repeat.
3. ~~**Agent Lab synthesis gap**~~ — `ForwardPointerCard` from `./shared` added to 6 core Agent Lab modules: ReActPattern, ToolUseDesign, AgentMemory, MultiAgentPatterns, AgentFailureModes, PlanningPatterns. Each accepts `{ onNavigate }` prop (already passed by parent). Two broken `onNavigate("preplab")` calls fixed → `onNavigate({ tab: "preplab", topic: "agents" })`.
4. ~~**Trap quality pass (lchain cluster)**~~ — 4 weak trap fields rewritten (lchain-2 through lchain-5) from MCQ-letter-referencing dismissals to overclaim→honest-reframe format naming the specific wrong assumption.

**Scale:** 597 PrepLab questions, 310 GT index entries (no new content this sprint).

---

## Sprint 79 — ✅ COMPLETE (`208d76d`, `6512b94`, `ba27ef8`)

### ~~P0 — Home page guest CTA fix~~ ✓ `208d76d`
RAG Lab entry card added to cold home hero before PrepLab card. "No account needed" label. Routes to `#lab`. PrepLab card demoted to secondary. RAG Lab now safe to link from LinkedIn.

### ~~P1 — SSR pre-render GT posts~~ ✓ `6512b94`
`scripts/prerender-gt.js` generates 318 static HTML pages at `public/gt/{id}.html`. `vercel.json` + `/gt/:id` rewrite. `package.json` build updated. `public/gt/` gitignored. `sitemap.xml` generated (7 static + 318 GT URLs).

### ~~P1 — Google Search Console~~ ✓ `ba27ef8`
HTML meta tag verification added to `index.html`. URL prefix property verified in Search Console.

**Pending (manual):**
- [ ] `git push origin main` — user action required
- [ ] Submit `sitemap.xml` in Search Console → Sitemaps tab after push + Vercel deploy

### Blocked (unchanged)
- Mastery Room commit (staged in sprint 60 — needs Supabase SQL run first).

---

## Sprint 80 — Next up

### P0 — LinkedIn launch (blocking: Jun 22 2026)
- **Voice pass on Week 1 posts** — all 20 posts need stage 7 humanize pass before scheduling. Week 1 (Mon–Fri Jun 22–26) is the gate. Do this FIRST.
- **Export carbon screenshots** — 4 code posts in Week 1 need carbon.now.sh images.
- **Schedule Week 1** — 5 posts scheduled at 8am IST Mon–Fri. Use LinkedIn native scheduler.
- RAG Lab first linkback: Week 3 Wed (RAG failures carousel), first comment only. Home page guest CTA is live — safe to link.

### P1 — ECOSYSTEM_LEDGER.md maintenance
Created this session at project root. Update STATE BOARD when GSL sprint state changes. All future cross-lab decisions go in DECISION LEDGER.

### P1 — Unified chat workflow
Session architecture locked: one chat, all folders mounted. No more per-lab separate sessions. Read ECOSYSTEM_LEDGER.md STATE BOARD at session start for cross-lab context.

### P2 — Mastery Room unblock
Run `supabase_study_tables.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor → commit 4 staged files → push. See MASTERY_ROOM.md for full state.

### Backlog (do not touch until LinkedIn cadence runs for 4 weeks)
- User flow audit (onboarding → RAG Lab → sign-in conversion)
- PostHog: verify VITE_POSTHOG_KEY is set in Vercel
- Agent/Eval Lab completion states (SystemsApp WhatNextCard)

---

## Sprint 68 — ✅ COMPLETE (`6f54650`)

**Objective:** LinkedIn soft launch infra — shareable deep links per challenge area with correct social OG previews + 5 LangChain questions.

1. ~~**6 static landing pages**~~ — `public/agents.html`, `retrieval.html`, `evaluation.html`, `production.html`, `foundations.html`, `preplab.html`. Each with area-specific og:title, og:description, colour, stats, CTA back into SPA.
2. ~~**vercel.json updated**~~ — 6 new rewrites + catch-all regex updated to exclude new HTML files.
3. ~~**index.html OG updated**~~ — "222+ posts" → "301 posts", "140+ modules" → accurate copy.
4. ~~**5 LangChain/LangGraph PrepLab questions**~~ — `lchain-1` through `lchain-5`. LCEL vs LangGraph decision, loop failure root cause, buffer memory cost explosion, tool count latency, faithfulness evaluation.

**UTM links for LinkedIn posts:**
- Agents: `https://genai-systems-lab-ivory.vercel.app/agents?utm_source=linkedin&utm_campaign=agents`
- Retrieval: `https://genai-systems-lab-ivory.vercel.app/retrieval?utm_source=linkedin&utm_campaign=retrieval`
- Evaluation: `https://genai-systems-lab-ivory.vercel.app/evaluation?utm_source=linkedin&utm_campaign=eval`
- Production: `https://genai-systems-lab-ivory.vercel.app/production?utm_source=linkedin&utm_campaign=prod`
- Foundations: `https://genai-systems-lab-ivory.vercel.app/foundations?utm_source=linkedin&utm_campaign=foundations`
- PrepLab: `https://genai-systems-lab-ivory.vercel.app/preplab?utm_source=linkedin&utm_campaign=preplab`

**PostHog required:** Set `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY` in Vercel env vars to track UTM → sign-up funnel. Without it, analytics are blind.

---

## Sprint 67 polish — ✅ COMPLETE (`e7fdb0a`, `83597fa`)

1. ~~**BrowseMode mobile layout**~~ — topic filter horizontal scroll, difficulty own row, responsive padding, MCQ overflow fix.
2. ~~**Sidebar challenge area desc line**~~ — muted `4 Concepts · N GT posts · Nq` hint below lab link when expanded.

---

## Sprint 67 — ✅ COMPLETE

**Objective:** Bug audit + renderer fix + Browse mode.

1. ~~**6 bug class audit + fixes in groundTruthPosts.js**~~ — DONE. `bee927a`, `3ccd359`, `7fe66bc`, `0cd366d`, `3ea40b3`.
2. ~~**normalizeBlock() in GroundTruth.jsx**~~ — DONE. All sprint 61–66 posts now render correctly. `3ea40b3`.
3. ~~**Browse All PrepLab mode**~~ — DONE. Topic+difficulty filters, expandable answer cards, mark-reviewed. `802cf17`.

**Process fix added:** Run `node -e "require('./validate.cjs')"` after every groundTruthPosts.js write.

---

## IMMEDIATE: Mastery Room needs 2 manual steps before it goes live

1. **Run SQL** — paste `supabase_study_tables.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor (creates 3 tables with RLS)
2. **Commit from terminal** — `git commit -m "feat: private mastery room"` + `git push` (sandbox can't remove HEAD.lock on macOS FUSE mount)

See MASTERY_ROOM.md for full details.

---

## Theme: BLOCKED on private test. No new feature builds until 3–5 person private test is complete and feedback reviewed.

**Current state:** Product is ready for guided private test. PRIVATE_TEST.md contains full tester profile, instructions, observer questions, and success criteria.

**Next decision gate:** Run 3–5 person private test → evaluate against success criteria → either (A) controlled public launch prep or (B) one more coherence sprint. Nothing else gets built until this decision is made.

### Do NOT build before private test feedback:
- Daily Judgment mechanic
- Stripe / real pricing
- SystemsApp completion states (P2 — not blocking)
- New content or labs
- Share cards / social mechanics
- Distribution push (HN, LinkedIn, Reddit)

**Sprint 56 UX correction pass — COMPLETE** ✅ (see CLAUDE.md sprint 56 log)

**Sprint 57 — PM audit complete. Build order:**

### P0 — ✅ DONE (sprint 58, commit `7b249ee`)

1. ~~**JTBD decision**~~ — DECISIONS.md §11 logged. Interview prep is primary frame.
2. ~~**Ungate RAG Lab Scenario 1 for guests**~~ — DONE. GUEST_ALLOWED_TABS includes "lab". Scenarios 2–6 locked via guard + UI.
3. ~~**First-time user path**~~ — DONE. `isFirstTime` banner on Progress page → "Open RAG Lab Scenario 1 →".
4. ~~**Synthesis card specificity**~~ — DONE. Names `failure_mode_taught`, PrepLab CTA topic-filtered, guest sign-in CTA after Scenario 1.
5. ~~**Navigation cleanup**~~ — DONE. "CHALLENGE AREAS" label, group labels removed, Plans moved to bottom.
6. ~~**Plans copy**~~ — DONE. "Community code free during beta" removed. "Invite-only during beta" framing.

**Real paid tier** — pricing decision still required. User action, not a code task. Do before distribution.

### Sprint 58 P1 — ✅ DONE (commit `80ca550`)

7. ~~**Mobile scenario strip guest lock**~~ — DONE. `mobileGuestLocked` + disabled + 🔒 on mobile pill buttons.
8. ~~**Plans "community code" copy in step 03**~~ — DONE. "community code" → "your access code".

---

## Sprint 59 — ✅ COMPLETE (commit `0d4f447`)

**Objective:** MVP coherence continued — verified real gaps vs. stale audit data.

### Key finding: stale PM audit data corrected

The PM audit (sprint 57) stated "8 evaluation GT posts." Code verification revealed **13 fully-written posts** (25–32 blocks each), added in sprint 51. The "write 4 new posts" plan in the audit was solving a problem that no longer existed.

Real gaps identified and fixed:
1. ~~EvaluationHub.jsx showed only 4 of 13 evaluation posts~~ — FIXED `0d4f447`. Hub now shows 8 posts (2×4 grid), "All 13 evaluation posts →" link updated.
2. ~~Agent Lab done-state was generic~~ — FIXED `0d4f447`. `AgentDesignChallenge` now shows `{challenge.title} — design scored` + production context + topic-filtered PrepLab CTA (`topic: "agents"`).

### Synthesis audit — final status

| Lab | Quality | PrepLab routing | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| RAG Lab | Strong — names `failure_mode_taught` | ✅ topic-filtered | Done |
| FM Lab | Good — `synthesisClose` + `preplabQ` rendered | ✅ specific question | Done |
| Prompt Lab | Good — `synthesis_close` + forward pointer | ⚠️ generic (personalized queue handles it) | Acceptable |
| Agent Lab | Now good — challenge title + production note | ✅ topic-filtered (`agents`) | Fixed sprint 59 |
| Eval Lab (SystemsApp) | No WhatNextCard in modules.jsx | ❌ none | P2 structural — too big for coherence sprint |
| LLM Lab (SystemsApp) | No WhatNextCard in modules.jsx | ❌ none | P2 structural — too big for coherence sprint |

### P2 — Deferred (not this sprint)

- SystemsApp (Eval/LLM Lab) completion states — structural M–L effort, each of ~57 modules needs a done-state. Requires dedicated sprint.
- Daily Judgment mechanic
- Hub room decision (needs PostHog data first)
- Concepts gym depth audit (user direction needed)
- Distribution push

### Do NOT build without explicit decision
- Stripe / real pricing
- Share cards
- Brand rename
- New labs or challenge areas

---

## Private user test checklist

**Ready for a 3–5 person guided private test.** Use this checklist.

### Who to invite
Mid-level software engineers (3–6 years) who are either actively interviewing for AI/ML engineering roles or plan to within 6 months. They should know basic ML/Python but don't need deep AI engineering experience. Do not invite people who already know the product well.

### Starting path
Send this link: `genai-systems-lab-ivory.vercel.app` — no instructions, no explanation. Let them land cold.

If they ask "what should I do?", only say: "try whatever looks interesting."

### First task to observe
Can they reach **RAG Lab Scenario 1** and complete it without being told to? This is the product's aha moment. If testers can't find it or don't finish it, the first-session path still needs work.

### Questions to ask after the session (5 minutes)

1. "What did you think this product was in the first 30 seconds?"
2. "What did you do first? Did you know what to do?"
3. "Did you complete a scenario in the RAG Lab? If yes — what did you take away from it?"
4. "Did the ending of the scenario feel like a learning moment, or just a task completed?"
5. "Would you come back to this? Why or why not?"
6. "What felt confusing or broken?"

### Signals that mean ready for broader distribution

- ≥3 of 5 testers reach and complete RAG Lab Scenario 1 without prompting
- ≥3 of 5 testers can articulate one specific failure mode they learned about
- ≥2 of 5 testers click the PrepLab CTA from the synthesis card
- ≥2 of 5 testers sign in (or would sign in if asked)
- Navigation confusion is specific ("I didn't see the Agents hub") not structural ("I didn't know what this product was")

### Signals that mean one more coherence sprint needed

- Majority can't explain what the product is after 5 minutes
- Majority don't find the RAG Lab without prompting
- Synthesis card doesn't land — testers say "I completed something but I'm not sure what I learned"
- Multiple testers hit broken states (React errors, empty pages, nav dead ends)

### P2 — Post-launch

9. **Hub room decision** — curated preview vs. full filtered room. Needs PostHog data on which areas get most engagement. Do not build until data exists.
10. **Concepts gym depth audit** — which gyms are hollow? User direction required.
11. **Brand clarity** — "GenAI Systems Lab" is descriptive but forgettable. Revisit after JTBD is confirmed.

**⚠️ USER ACTION REQUIRED:** PostHog WAU check + pricing decision (P0 item 4). Both are required before distribution.

Sprint 49: full challenge-layer redesign (R1–R9). Sprint 50: readiness layer, guided paths, staffLayer 30→41. See CLAUDE.md sprint log.
